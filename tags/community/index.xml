The goal of this server is to create a community of nice and diverse people who are researching human-centric data science and adjacent topics. For example human-centric data/network science, social data science, urban/geospatial data science, computational social science. Not welcome: bullies, harassers, big abusive/toxic egos.
This instance aims to counter the danger of surveillance capitalism screwing up social media and manipulating public opinion, as demonstrated recently by Twitter&amp;rsquo;s demise.</description></item><item><title>Moderation</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/docs/moderation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/docs/moderation/</guid><description>Team All moderation and administration is done by our volunteer admin(istrator) and mod(erator) team:

Here my (Michael&amp;rsquo;s) short answer:
Has datasci.social suspended or limited the threads.net domain?
No.
Will datasci.social suspend or limit the threads.net domain?
Possibly, if/whenever necessary. We are closely monitoring the situation.
Long answer: Given Meta&amp;rsquo;s abysmal history with surveillance capitalism and human rights it is reasonable to consider Threads a bad faith actor, meaning that its activities should be assumed to underlie as exploitative as possible motives.</description></item><item><title>One year old</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-11-17/one-year-old/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Nov 2023 06:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-11-17/one-year-old/</guid><description>One year ago, datasci.social was created! ü•≥üéÇ In this time datasci.social has become a vibrant online community with 286 people who have joined from all over the world, from various disciplines or from industry, providing an online home for the data science community, broadly defined.
