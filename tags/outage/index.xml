The difference to 100% was due to two unplanned downtimes of around 4 hours each. Our uptime from our founding in Nov 2022 until now is 99.923%, meaning a downtime of 34 minutes per month on average.
We strive to keep this high reliability. Despite not being a commercial service, our reliability level fulfils the 99.</description></item><item><title>4h server outage</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-09-06/4h-server-outage/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Sep 2023 15:30:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-09-06/4h-server-outage/</guid><description>We had an unplanned server outage on saturday for 4h14min, for technical reasons.

We had a slight hiccup at datasci.social with our email provider in the last ~16 hours which has been resolved now. (Was due to #TwitterMigration) Sorry for any delays in receiving system emails, like for sign-up. #mastoadmin #serverinfo</description></item></channel></rss>
