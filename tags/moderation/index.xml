&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://community.datasci.social/images/reportpost.png" alt="How to report a post" title="How to report a post">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When our team receives reports through Mastodon&amp;rsquo;s report interface, we decide whether to resolve without action or which action to take depending on severity and repeat offense. The action can range from deletion of offending posts, warning, temporal limiting an account&amp;rsquo;s posts from showing in feeds, or account suspension. If an account from a different server is suspended, that account is banned from interacting with our server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If an action is required, the first action for minor offenses is usually a warning, ramping up in severity for repeat offenses. We aim to be as reasonable as possible, and we do not let racism, sexism, etc. off the hook - even if perceived as minor. Though we have done our best to formulate &lt;a href="https://community.datasci.social/docs/server-rules">our server rules&lt;/a> concisely and comprehensively, this list is not all-inclusive and there can always be unforeseen situations that need to be handled on an individual basis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please always use Mastodon&amp;rsquo;s report interface - reports communicated directly to mod/admin accounts (for example via direct message) will not be processed. If for any reason using Mastodon&amp;rsquo;s report interface is not possible, write us to our admin contact email address as a last resort.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="server-based-moderation-blocklist">Server-based moderation (blocklist)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Blocklists are a way that a Mastodon instance can handle unwanted content on the instance level. When a Mastodon domain is on our blocklist (see &lt;a href="https://datasci.social/about">&lt;em>Moderated servers&lt;/em>&lt;/a>), this means that our admins have limited or completely suspended activity with the server at that domain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How we curate our blocklist:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Initial import from the trusted instance &lt;a href="https://mastodon.social/about">mastodon.social&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adding or removing new instances as needed&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Need to add can arise for example when many accounts from a specific instance are reported and if the inadequacy of that instance&amp;rsquo;s local moderation is known. We try to be reasonable: It can be important to block fast, but &lt;a href="https://blog.codeberg.org/how-blocklists-prevent-the-internet-to-be-decentralized-and-safe.html">too indiscriminate blocking can also be harmful&lt;/a>. If you have good reason we should add or remove an instance from our blocklist, please contact us at our admin email address and include clear context.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: Server rules</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/docs/server-rules/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/docs/server-rules/</guid><description>

&lt;p>This page should always be held in sync with the &lt;a href="https://datasci.social/about">server rules&lt;/a> and therefore be edited only by an admin, so the github change log of this page serves as a rule change log.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t be a jerk. We expect to treat each other respectfully.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, or casteism&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No incitement of violence or promotion of violent ideologies&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No harassment, dogpiling, doxxing, or impersonation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No content that is considered illegal in Denmark or France&lt;/li>

&lt;li>No spam or commercial advertisements&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nothing NSFW (not safe for work), such as sexually explicit or violent media&lt;/li>
&lt;li>SIGN-UP: This is not a generalist server and is destined for professionals in human-centric data science. Please register here only if that is the case. To get accepted for sign-up, specify your fit and provide a link to your ORCID (&lt;a href="https://orcid.org/XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX">https://orcid.org/XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX&lt;/a>) in the &amp;ldquo;Why do you want to join?&amp;rdquo; field.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Before doing so, let us clarify our &lt;a href="https://community.datasci.social/docs/management/#raison-d%C3%AAtre">philosophy&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://community.datasci.social/docs/roadmap/">roadmap&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-present-and-future-of-datascisocial">The present and future of datasci.social&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The instance was set up on Nov 17, 2022, for this reason:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The goal of this server is to create a community of nice and diverse people who are researching human-centric data science and adjacent topics. For example human-centric data/network science, social data science, urban/geospatial data science, computational social science. Not welcome: bullies, harassers, big abusive/toxic egos.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Because this server was set up with personal funding, it initially only covered up to 100 active users. Therefore it was joinable by invitation only. After a first batch of invites and snowball invites, we have grown to around 50 active members so far. However, it still feels quite empty, and after &lt;a href="https://community.datasci.social/blog/2022-12-17/poll-on-growth/">an informal poll showed enough interest in growth&lt;/a> we now decided to expand server capacity and to open registrations temporarily to grow.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="philosophy-and-motivation">Philosophy, and motivation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The server capacity has just been expanded from about 100 to 500 active members. It is still only financed from personal pockets, but we plan to soon set up a donation page where anybody can chip in if they want to help out. We have created datasci.social to counter the danger of surveillance capitalism screwing up social media and manipulating public opinion, as demonstrated recently by Twitter&amp;rsquo;s demise. We believe we can do things better in a &amp;ldquo;grassroots&amp;rdquo; approach. If you agree, then datasci.social could be a fitting place for you. And if you just came to post/discuss about research - that&amp;rsquo;s perfect! 👍&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="management-security-and-trust">Management, security and trust&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Growing a community needs to be done in a responsible way - as we know from &lt;a href="https://github.com/mszell/mastoadminresources/blob/main/communityguide.md">20 years of community management experience&lt;/a>. Therefore, we made sure to adhere to the &lt;a href="https://joinmastodon.org/covenant">Mastodon covenant&lt;/a>, which specifies that there should be at least two people with emergency server access, and that in case of a shutdown 3 months advance notice must be given to have enough time for people to download their data and emigrate. Further, we have assembled a competent and diverse admin/mod team, which currently consists of &lt;a href="https://datasci.social/@benfmaier">Ben F. Maier&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://datasci.social/@eflegara">Erika Legara&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://datasci.social/@estebanmoro">Esteban Moro&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://datasci.social/@mszll">Michael Szell&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://datasci.social/@sdesojo">Silvia De Sojo Caso&lt;/a>. Moderation was not needed so far at all, but we are preparing to grow also this important part for the community, as needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="plans-for-2023">Plans for 2023&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>For 2023 we just extended our server capacity, we ensured adherence to the &lt;a href="https://joinmastodon.org/covenant">covenant&lt;/a>, and we have set up &lt;a href="https://community.datasci.social">our community pages&lt;/a> to communicate updates. We have also opened registrations, and will close them once we have reached 300 members. Inspired by other science servers, registration at datasci.social requires stating a reason and your ORCID, followed by manual approval by our mod/admin team (which we aim to provide fast). This is just to make sure that we actually get researchers/professionals to sign up, and to avoid the server getting swamped overnight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will soon set up a donations page, monitor and adjust our server rules and community documents transparently, and grow our admin/mod team if needed. If we take any major new steps, this would be done only after some time to give the community enough time to build up and stabilize.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="plans-beyond-2023">Plans beyond 2023&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>For the long-term we are very open to continue diluting power in the spirit of decentralization, so that datasci.social may establish a governance structure where there is never the danger that one person or a small group can screw up everything - if there is interest. Concerning growth, ideally we should not surpass some hundred active members, as more than that could become unmanageable. We are totally open to let datasci.social&amp;rsquo;s governance develop in any conceivable stable way, from a group-led instance to a self-organized, community-governed entity like &lt;a href="https://www.loomio.com/socialcoop">social.coop&lt;/a>. We will see what works best.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you think you fit and are interested to join &lt;a href="https://datasci.social">datasci.social&lt;/a>, we encourage you to do so. But don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate too long, because 300 members could be reached quite soon. In any case, have fun with Mastodon!&lt;/p>
