Here my (Michael&amp;rsquo;s) short answer:
Has datasci.social suspended or limited the threads.net domain?
No.
Will datasci.social suspend or limit the threads.net domain?
Possibly, if/whenever necessary. We are closely monitoring the situation.
Long answer: Given Meta&amp;rsquo;s abysmal history with surveillance capitalism and human rights it is reasonable to consider Threads a bad faith actor, meaning that its activities should be assumed to underlie as exploitative as possible motives.</description></item><item><title>One year old</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-11-17/one-year-old/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Nov 2023 06:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-11-17/one-year-old/</guid><description>One year ago, datasci.social was created! ü•≥üéÇ In this time datasci.social has become a vibrant online community with 286 people who have joined from all over the world, from various disciplines or from industry, providing an online home for the data science community, broadly defined. Explore our awesome stream here: https://datasci.social/public/local
There has been smooth, mostly constant growth over the past year, and luckily we have been facing no moderative or technical challenges.</description></item><item><title>New admin</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-04-28/new-admin/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Apr 2023 10:26:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-04-28/new-admin/</guid><description>One more admin joined our team today: Lucio La Cava (@luciolcw)
Lucio is a researcher researching the social network of Mastodon, so he has particular insights into the system.
We still had zero moderative reports on our server so far, and we have a calm pace of new sign-ups. Therefore, there is currently no necessity to extend our team, but we want to be well prepared for a possible flood of sign-ups in case other, larger online social networks collapse.</description></item><item><title>100 members</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-02-27/100-members/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2023 10:30:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-02-27/100-members/</guid><description>We have reached 100 members on https://datasci.social! ü•≥
Since opening registrations in Jan with 50 members we have doubled in size, following a nice pace of growth. We are now also steadily posting over 100 new posts/week.
With ample capacity to grow, we encourage everyone interested in data science, network science, computational social science, and related fields to join us, or to spread the word about our place. Although we have 5 mods/admins, we still had no single moderative report so far.</description></item><item><title>Registrations opened</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-01-12/registrations-opened/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2023 11:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-01-12/registrations-opened/</guid><description>üö® Registrations at datasci.social are now open!

Before doing so, let us clarify our philosophy and roadmap:
The present and future of datasci.social The instance was set up on Nov 17, 2022, for this reason:
The goal of this server is to create a community of nice and diverse people who are researching human-centric data science and adjacent topics. For example human-centric data/network science, social data science, urban/geospatial data science, computational social science.</description></item><item><title>New team, roadmap, community pages</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-01-06/new-team-roadmap-community-pages/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jan 2023 11:42:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-01-06/new-team-roadmap-community-pages/</guid><description>In preparation for opening datasci.social registrations next week, some news üö®
