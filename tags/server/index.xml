The goal of this server is to create a community of nice and diverse people who are researching human-centric data science and adjacent topics. For example human-centric data/network science, social data science, urban/geospatial data science, computational social science. Not welcome: bullies, harassers, big abusive/toxic egos.
This instance aims to counter the danger of surveillance capitalism screwing up social media and manipulating public opinion, as demonstrated recently by Twitter&amp;rsquo;s demise.</description></item><item><title>Server</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/docs/server/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/docs/server/</guid><description>Our server is hosted in the world&amp;rsquo;s largest data center in France and managed by experienced Mastodon server admins.

We strive to keep this high reliability.

Since opening registrations in Jan with 50 members we have doubled in size, following a nice pace of growth. We are now also steadily posting over 100 new posts/week.
With ample capacity to grow, we encourage everyone interested in data science, network science, computational social science, and related fields to join us, or to spread the word about our place. Although we have 5 mods/admins, we still had no single moderative report so far.</description></item><item><title>Mastodon version updated to 4.1.0</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-02-22/mastodon-version-updated-to-4.1.0/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2023 21:50:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-02-22/mastodon-version-updated-to-4.1.0/</guid><description>Our server https://datasci.social just got its Mastodon version upgraded to the latest version 4.1.0 which was released two weeks ago. Most notably, you can now add alt text to images you have already posted or edit existing alt text. It has been frustrating until now to be unable to add/edit forgotten or incorrect alt text.
Apart from alt texts and many small fixes, it is now possible for admins to import server-wide domain blocks which might come in handy for server-level moderation.</description></item><item><title>Registrations opened</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-01-12/registrations-opened/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2023 11:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-01-12/registrations-opened/</guid><description>üö® Registrations at datasci.social are now open!
