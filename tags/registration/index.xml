Explore our awesome stream here: https://datasci.social/public/local
There has been smooth, mostly constant growth over the past year, and luckily we have been facing no moderative or technical challenges.</description></item><item><title>100 members</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-02-27/100-members/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2023 10:30:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-02-27/100-members/</guid><description>We have reached 100 members on https://datasci.social! ü•≥
Since opening registrations in Jan with 50 members we have doubled in size, following a nice pace of growth. We are now also steadily posting over 100 new posts/week.
With ample capacity to grow, we encourage everyone interested in data science, network science, computational social science, and related fields to join us, or to spread the word about our place. Although we have 5 mods/admins, we still had no single moderative report so far.</description></item><item><title>Growth after open registration</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-01-19/growth-after-open-registration/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2023 12:12:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-01-19/growth-after-open-registration/</guid><description>Update after 1 week of open registrations at datasci.social: We had 24 new signups, growing to 64 active members.

Before doing so, let us clarify our philosophy and roadmap:
The present and future of datasci.social The instance was set up on Nov 17, 2022, for this reason:
The goal of this server is to create a community of nice and diverse people who are researching human-centric data science and adjacent topics. For example human-centric data/network science, social data science, urban/geospatial data science, computational social science.</description></item><item><title>New team, roadmap, community pages</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-01-06/new-team-roadmap-community-pages/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jan 2023 11:42:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-01-06/new-team-roadmap-community-pages/</guid><description>In preparation for opening datasci.social registrations next week, some news üö®

If registrations were open, would you join https://datasci.social? :python: :rstats: :networkx:
(Context: Registrations are currently closed due to limited budget/capacity, but we could consider to grow in 2023. No promises though! #serverinfo #mastoadmin )</description></item><item><title>Invite only registrations</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2022-11-17/invite-only-registrations/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2022 08:18:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2022-11-17/invite-only-registrations/</guid><description>[Post copied from https://datasci.social/@mszll/109365042571003803]
About our #server https://datasci.social: We are doing invite-only sign-ups for now for technical/budget reasons, and not because of elitism. And because a slow ramp-up is more healthy for the community, #moderation etc.
(I have run a massive online community for 20 years, 15k active users at peak, so I have some idea what I am doing. #mastoadmin #serverinfo üëç )</description></item></channel></rss>
