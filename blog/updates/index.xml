The difference to 100% was due to two unplanned downtimes of around 4 hours each. Our uptime from our founding in Nov 2022 until now is 99.923%, meaning a downtime of 34 minutes per month on average.
We strive to keep this high reliability. Despite not being a commercial service, our reliability level fulfils the 99.</description></item><item><title>Mastodon version updated to 4.2.5</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2024-02-02/mastodon-version-updated-to-4.2.5/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2024 18:50:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2024-02-02/mastodon-version-updated-to-4.2.5/</guid><description>Our server https://datasci.social got its Mastodon version upgraded to the latest version 4.2.5 yesterday, immediately after a critical vulnerability became public: https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/security/advisories/GHSA-3fjr-858r-92rw.
This long overdue update from version 4.1.9 also comes with new features that were added in the 4.2.x line, for example privacy settings where you can control if you want your posts to appear in search or on the Explore page. Both are opt-in, so if you want to have this, make sure to enable them: https://datasci.</description></item><item><title>Our stance on Threads</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-12-17/our-stance-on-threads/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Dec 2023 14:57:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-12-17/our-stance-on-threads/</guid><description>With Meta&amp;rsquo;s Threads recently starting concrete federation experiments, we have been asked about datasci.social&amp;rsquo;s stance concerning preemptive suspension (also called &amp;ldquo;defederation&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;fediblock&amp;rdquo;).
Here my (Michael&amp;rsquo;s) short answer:
Has datasci.social suspended or limited the threads.net domain?
No.
Will datasci.social suspend or limit the threads.net domain?
Possibly, if/whenever necessary. We are closely monitoring the situation.
Long answer: Given Meta&amp;rsquo;s abysmal history with surveillance capitalism and human rights it is reasonable to consider Threads a bad faith actor, meaning that its activities should be assumed to underlie as exploitative as possible motives.</description></item><item><title>Thank you to our supporters!</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-10-24/thank-you-to-our-supporters/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 13:57:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-10-24/thank-you-to-our-supporters/</guid><description>We have more and more financial supporters that help us maintain our datasci.social Mastodon instance - A big thank you to all our supporters! ‚ù§Ô∏è
We are now covering around half of our running server expenses with voluntary donations, which is great news for sustaining datasci.social in the long term. Every single $ helps. There are no commercial interests behind datasci.social, just people who aim to build a good community around data science (broadly defined), therefore we will always be ad-free.</description></item><item><title>4h server outage</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-09-06/4h-server-outage/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Sep 2023 15:30:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-09-06/4h-server-outage/</guid><description>We had an unplanned server outage on saturday for 4h14min, for technical reasons. We are sorry for the downtime and thank you for your understanding.
This downtime has decreased our server uptime in this year to 99.86%, which is still less than an hour downtime per month.</description></item><item><title>Six months old</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-05-19/six-months-old/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 19:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-05-19/six-months-old/</guid><description>This week https://datasci.social has turned 6 months old ü•≥
We are 133 people now (68 active), with increased growth in the past few weeks. Our server hosts a community for #DataScience, broadly defined. See below our place in the universe of servers:
Our operation is financed via donations, we are grateful for support: https://community.datasci.social/docs/support/</description></item><item><title>New admin</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-04-28/new-admin/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Apr 2023 10:26:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-04-28/new-admin/</guid><description>One more admin joined our team today: Lucio La Cava (@luciolcw)
Lucio is a researcher researching the social network of Mastodon, so he has particular insights into the system.
We still had zero moderative reports on our server so far, and we have a calm pace of new sign-ups. Therefore, there is currently no necessity to extend our team, but we want to be well prepared for a possible flood of sign-ups in case other, larger online social networks collapse.</description></item><item><title>4h server outage</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-03-02/4h-server-outage/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2023 16:40:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-03-02/4h-server-outage/</guid><description>We just had a server outage for 3h51min. We are sorry for the downtime. The reason had to do with a release of the IP by the infrastructure provider. According to our server host this is being worked on so it cannot happen again. Thank you for your understanding.</description></item><item><title>Donations pages opened</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-02-28/donations-pages-opened/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2023 14:40:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-02-28/donations-pages-opened/</guid><description>We opened a Patreon page to allow our members supporting our running costs financially, which is several 100$ per year: https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=88962596
We will list supporters on our support page: https://community.datasci.social/docs/support/
We appreciate any support - every $ counts, and all goes directly to server hosting and maintenance!</description></item><item><title>100 members</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-02-27/100-members/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2023 10:30:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-02-27/100-members/</guid><description>We have reached 100 members on https://datasci.social! ü•≥
Since opening registrations in Jan with 50 members we have doubled in size, following a nice pace of growth. We are now also steadily posting over 100 new posts/week.
With ample capacity to grow, we encourage everyone interested in data science, network science, computational social science, and related fields to join us, or to spread the word about our place. Although we have 5 mods/admins, we still had no single moderative report so far.</description></item><item><title>Mastodon version updated to 4.1.0</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-02-22/mastodon-version-updated-to-4.1.0/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2023 21:50:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-02-22/mastodon-version-updated-to-4.1.0/</guid><description>Our server https://datasci.social just got its Mastodon version upgraded to the latest version 4.1.0 which was released two weeks ago. Most notably, you can now add alt text to images you have already posted or edit existing alt text. It has been frustrating until now to be unable to add/edit forgotten or incorrect alt text.
Apart from alt texts and many small fixes, it is now possible for admins to import server-wide domain blocks which might come in handy for server-level moderation.</description></item><item><title>Growth after open registration</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-01-19/growth-after-open-registration/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2023 12:12:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-01-19/growth-after-open-registration/</guid><description>Update after 1 week of open registrations at datasci.social: We had 24 new signups, growing to 64 active members.

About our #server https://datasci.social: We are doing invite-only sign-ups for now for technical/budget reasons, and not because of elitism. And because a slow ramp-up is more healthy for the community, #moderation etc.
