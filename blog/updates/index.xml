&lt;p>We crunched the numbers and are happy to report that in 2023 &lt;a href="https://datasci.social">https://datasci.social&lt;/a> had an uptime of 99.908%. The difference to 100% was due to two unplanned downtimes of around 4 hours each. Our uptime from our founding in Nov 2022 until now is 99.923%, meaning a downtime of 34 minutes per month on average.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We strive to keep this high reliability. Despite not being a commercial service, our reliability level fulfils the 99.9% Service Level Agreements of cloud services of major industry players like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Mastodon version updated to 4.2.5</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2024-02-02/mastodon-version-updated-to-4.2.5/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2024 18:50:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2024-02-02/mastodon-version-updated-to-4.2.5/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Our server &lt;a href="https://datasci.social">https://datasci.social&lt;/a> got its Mastodon version upgraded to the latest version 4.2.5 yesterday, immediately after a critical vulnerability became public: &lt;a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/security/advisories/GHSA-3fjr-858r-92rw">https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/security/advisories/GHSA-3fjr-858r-92rw&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This long overdue update from version 4.1.9 also comes with &lt;a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/09/mastodon-4.2/">new features that were added in the 4.2.x line&lt;/a>, for example privacy settings where you can control if you want your posts to appear in search or on the Explore page. Both are opt-in, so if you want to have this, make sure to enable them: &lt;a href="https://datasci.social/settings/privacy">https://datasci.social/settings/privacy&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Our stance on Threads</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-12-17/our-stance-on-threads/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Dec 2023 14:57:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-12-17/our-stance-on-threads/</guid><description>
&lt;p>With Meta&amp;rsquo;s Threads recently starting &lt;a href="https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/111576825980285552">concrete federation experiments&lt;/a>, we have been asked about datasci.social&amp;rsquo;s stance concerning preemptive suspension (also called &amp;ldquo;defederation&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;fediblock&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here my (Michael&amp;rsquo;s) short answer:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Has datasci.social suspended or limited the threads.net domain?&lt;br>
No.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Will datasci.social suspend or limit the threads.net domain?&lt;br>
Possibly, if/whenever necessary. We are closely monitoring the situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Long answer: Given Meta&amp;rsquo;s abysmal history with surveillance capitalism and human rights it is reasonable to consider Threads a bad faith actor, meaning that its activities should be assumed to underlie as exploitative as possible motives. In the context of Mastodon this could mean some kind of &amp;ldquo;Embrace, extend, and extinguish&amp;rdquo; strategy, indiscriminate data collection, or worse. Therefore we are empathethic with any server admin who preemptively suspends or limits the threads.net domain. From our side however, we do not follow this strategy at the moment, because:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Suspending an entire instance is a huge, irreversible hammer. As per our &lt;a href="https://community.datasci.social/docs/moderation/#server-based-moderation-blocklist">community pages&lt;/a>, &amp;ldquo;we try to be reasonable: It can be important to block fast, but too indiscriminate blocking can also be harmful&amp;rdquo;. Since individuals can already block a whole domain by themselves, a server-side suspension should not be implemented rashly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is not yet clear what potential benefits there could be from Threads federating. Although there might be little - or the cons might easily outweigh any pros - we need more information to understand this evolving situation before jumping to conclusions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There seems to be no imminent danger yet. This gives us time to first have a considerate discussion between all admins, moderators, and other members of datasci.social. Should there be an imminent danger at any point, we would of course reevaluate quickly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Even without any imminent danger, the reasonable point could be made that a federated Threads will undermine the Fediverse slowly or indirectly. Again, whenever there are concrete indications that this is happening or about to happen, we will act accordingly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>See more detailed arguments here: &lt;a href="https://www.timothychambers.net/2023/06/23/project-and-the.html">https://www.timothychambers.net/2023/06/23/project-and-the.html&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>We will stay vigilant and keep monitoring the situation. For now we treat threads.net just as any other instance, and we are ready to react fast if necessary. At the same time, should we ever decide that we want to limit or suspend threads.net, we will aim to give as much advance notice as possible - especially if doing so could disrupt our members. Peace!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Thank you to our supporters!</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-10-24/thank-you-to-our-supporters/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 13:57:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-10-24/thank-you-to-our-supporters/</guid><description>

&lt;p>One more admin joined our &lt;a href="https://community.datasci.social/docs/moderation/#team">team&lt;/a> today: Lucio La Cava (&lt;a href="https://datasci.social/@luciolcw">@luciolcw&lt;/a>)&lt;br>
Lucio is a researcher researching the social network of Mastodon, so he has particular insights into the system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We still had zero moderative reports on our server so far, and we have a calm pace of new sign-ups. Therefore, there is currently no necessity to extend our team, but we want to be well prepared for a possible flood of sign-ups in case other, larger online social networks collapse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Welcome Lucio to the team, thank you for volunteering at datasci.social!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: 4h server outage</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-03-02/4h-server-outage/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2023 16:40:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-03-02/4h-server-outage/</guid><description>
&lt;p>We just had a server outage for 3h51min. We are sorry for the downtime. The reason had to do with a release of the IP by the infrastructure provider. According to our server host this is being worked on so it cannot happen again. Thank you for your understanding.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Donations pages opened</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-02-28/donations-pages-opened/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2023 14:40:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-02-28/donations-pages-opened/</guid><description>

&lt;p>We have reached 100 members on &lt;a href="https://datasci.social">https://datasci.social&lt;/a>! 🥳&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since opening registrations in Jan with 50 members we have doubled in size, following a nice pace of growth. We are now also steadily posting over 100 new posts/week.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With ample capacity to grow, we encourage everyone interested in data science, network science, computational social science, and related fields to join us, or to spread the word about our place. Although we have 5 mods/admins, we still had no single moderative report so far. Our server had 99.998% uptime. Smooth sailing!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our next step is to implement a support page for members to have the possibility to donate to the running costs of our server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enjoy and see you on Mastodon!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our server &lt;a href="https://datasci.social">https://datasci.social&lt;/a> just got its Mastodon version upgraded to the latest version 4.1.0 which was released two weeks ago. Most notably, you can now add alt text to images you have already posted or edit existing alt text. It has been frustrating until now to be unable to add/edit forgotten or incorrect alt text.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apart from alt texts and many small fixes, it is now possible for admins to import server-wide domain blocks which might come in handy for server-level moderation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See the full release notes here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v4.1.0">https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v4.1.0&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Growth after open registration</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-01-19/growth-after-open-registration/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2023 12:12:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-01-19/growth-after-open-registration/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Update after 1 week of open registrations at datasci.social: We had 24 new signups, growing to 64 active members. This is a nice pace - everything running smoothly. We have capacity for much more 😎 #mastoadmin #serverinfo&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We had a slight hiccup at datasci.social with our email provider in the last ~16 hours which has been resolved now. (Was due to #TwitterMigration) Sorry for any delays in receiving system emails, like for sign-up. #mastoadmin #serverinfo&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Custom emojis added</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2022-11-19/custom-emojis-added/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Nov 2022 22:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2022-11-19/custom-emojis-added/</guid><description>

&lt;p>About our #server &lt;a href="https://datasci.social">https://datasci.social&lt;/a>: We are doing invite-only sign-ups for now for technical/budget reasons, and not because of elitism. And because a slow ramp-up is more healthy for the community, #moderation etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(I have run a massive online community for 20 years, 15k active users at peak, so I have some idea what I am doing. #mastoadmin #serverinfo 👍 )&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
