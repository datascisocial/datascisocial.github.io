&lt;p&gt;This long overdue update from version 4.4.1 also comes with &lt;a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2025/11/mastodon-4.5/"&gt;new features that were added in the 4.5.x line one month ago&lt;/a&gt;, most notably quote posts.

The new detailed information reads as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accounts that make automated posts must: 1) ask for permission at signup or from the moderation team, 2) check &amp;ldquo;This is an automated account&amp;rdquo; in their profile, 3) not create more than one post per day, unless permitted by the moderation team.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Image loading issues</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2025-06-06/image-loading-issues/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 08:10:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2025-06-06/image-loading-issues/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://datasci.social/@mszll/114624016346626261"&gt;announced yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, we had some image loading issues in the last two days, where some images did not load, and images could not be added to posts. By now, the problem has resolved itself automatically - thank you for your understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this outage was the migration to a more stable provider to avoid &lt;a href="https://community.datasci.social/blog/2025-04-20/10h-server-outage/"&gt;full outages like the last one in April&lt;/a&gt;: An additional cache for images was added that also stores the data in an efficient manner, but due to the large initial load some of its requests were timing out to the backend. To resolve this quicker, our server admins were increasing the timeouts, and were also manually pushing data into it so it had data before the initial request.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>10h server outage</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2025-04-20/10h-server-outage/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 09:30:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2025-04-20/10h-server-outage/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We had an unplanned server outage between April 15th and 17th for 10h01min, for technical reasons.

&lt;p&gt;The server admins took care of the issue asap, but we are only able to communicate it now due to easter holidays.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Threads suspended</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2025-01-20/threads-suspended/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 06:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2025-01-20/threads-suspended/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://datasci.social/@mszll/113798322214417466"&gt;announced two weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;, we suspended, or &amp;ldquo;defederated from&amp;rdquo;, threads.net today. So far &lt;a href="https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-12-17/our-stance-on-threads/"&gt;we have given the platform the benefit of the doubt following a vigilant &amp;ldquo;wait and see&amp;rdquo; approach&lt;/a&gt; - while hoping that this connection could bring about something positive. Unfortunately, with the recent change towards a &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/meta-immigration-gender-policies-change/"&gt;purposefully dehumanizing moderation policy&lt;/a&gt;, federation with Threads has become incompatible for us. It does not help that, at the same time, &lt;a href="https://www.404media.co/meta-is-blocking-links-to-decentralized-instagram-competitor-pixelfed/"&gt;Meta is sabotaging the open web through censorship&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>99.908% Uptime in 2023</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2024-02-03/99.908-uptime-in-2023/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Feb 2024 17:08:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2024-02-03/99.908-uptime-in-2023/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We crunched the numbers and are happy to report that in 2023 &lt;a href="https://datasci.social"&gt;https://datasci.social&lt;/a&gt; had an uptime of 99.908%. The difference to 100% was due to two unplanned downtimes of around 4 hours each. Our uptime from our founding in Nov 2022 until now is 99.923%, meaning a downtime of 34 minutes per month on average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We strive to keep this high reliability. Despite not being a commercial service, our reliability level fulfils the 99.9% Service Level Agreements of cloud services of major industry players like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Mastodon version updated to 4.2.5</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2024-02-02/mastodon-version-updated-to-4.2.5/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2024 18:50:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2024-02-02/mastodon-version-updated-to-4.2.5/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Our server &lt;a href="https://datasci.social"&gt;https://datasci.social&lt;/a&gt; got its Mastodon version upgraded to the latest version 4.2.5 yesterday, immediately after a critical vulnerability became public: &lt;a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/security/advisories/GHSA-3fjr-858r-92rw"&gt;https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/security/advisories/GHSA-3fjr-858r-92rw&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This long overdue update from version 4.1.9 also comes with &lt;a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/09/mastodon-4.2/"&gt;new features that were added in the 4.2.x line&lt;/a&gt;, for example privacy settings where you can control if you want your posts to appear in search or on the Explore page. Both are opt-in, so if you want to have this, make sure to enable them: &lt;a href="https://datasci.social/settings/privacy"&gt;https://datasci.social/settings/privacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Our stance on Threads</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-12-17/our-stance-on-threads/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Dec 2023 14:57:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-12-17/our-stance-on-threads/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;With Meta&amp;rsquo;s Threads recently starting &lt;a href="https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/111576825980285552"&gt;concrete federation experiments&lt;/a&gt;, we have been asked about datasci.social&amp;rsquo;s stance concerning preemptive suspension (also called &amp;ldquo;defederation&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;fediblock&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here my (Michael&amp;rsquo;s) short answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has datasci.social suspended or limited the threads.net domain?&lt;br&gt;
No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will datasci.social suspend or limit the threads.net domain?&lt;br&gt;
Possibly, if/whenever necessary. We are closely monitoring the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long answer: Given Meta&amp;rsquo;s abysmal history with surveillance capitalism and human rights it is reasonable to consider Threads a bad faith actor, meaning that its activities should be assumed to underlie as exploitative as possible motives. In the context of Mastodon this could mean some kind of &amp;ldquo;Embrace, extend, and extinguish&amp;rdquo; strategy, indiscriminate data collection, or worse. Therefore we are empathethic with any server admin who preemptively suspends or limits the threads.net domain. From our side however, we do not follow this strategy at the moment, because:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Thank you to our supporters!</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-10-24/thank-you-to-our-supporters/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 13:57:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-10-24/thank-you-to-our-supporters/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We have more and more financial supporters that help us maintain our datasci.social Mastodon instance - A big thank you to &lt;a href="https://community.datasci.social/docs/support/#supporters"&gt;all our supporters&lt;/a&gt;! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now covering around half of our running server expenses with voluntary donations, which is great news for sustaining datasci.social in the long term. Every single $ helps. There are no commercial interests behind datasci.social, just people who aim to build a good community around data science (broadly defined), therefore we will &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; be ad-free. We strive to provide the best possible service with &lt;a href="https://community.datasci.social/docs/moderation/#team"&gt;voluntary moderators/admins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://community.datasci.social/docs/server/#historical-uptimes"&gt;as few as possible downtimes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>4h server outage</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-09-06/4h-server-outage/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Sep 2023 15:30:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-09-06/4h-server-outage/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We had an unplanned server outage on saturday for 4h14min, for technical reasons. We are sorry for the downtime and thank you for your understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This downtime has decreased our server uptime in this year to 99.86%, which is still less than an hour downtime per month.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Six months old</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-05-19/six-months-old/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 19:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-05-19/six-months-old/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This week &lt;a href="https://datasci.social"&gt;https://datasci.social&lt;/a&gt; has turned 6 months old 🥳&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are 133 people now (68 active), with increased growth in the past few weeks. Our server hosts a community for #DataScience, broadly defined. See below our place in the universe of servers:&lt;/p&gt;

Lucio is a researcher researching the social network of Mastodon, so he has particular insights into the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still had zero moderative reports on our server so far, and we have a calm pace of new sign-ups. Therefore, there is currently no necessity to extend our team, but we want to be well prepared for a possible flood of sign-ups in case other, larger online social networks collapse.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>4h server outage</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-03-02/4h-server-outage/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2023 16:40:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-03-02/4h-server-outage/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We just had a server outage for 3h51min. We are sorry for the downtime. The reason had to do with a release of the IP by the infrastructure provider. According to our server host this is being worked on so it cannot happen again.

&lt;p&gt;Since opening registrations in Jan with 50 members we have doubled in size, following a nice pace of growth. We are now also steadily posting over 100 new posts/week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With ample capacity to grow, we encourage everyone interested in data science, network science, computational social science, and related fields to join us, or to spread the word about our place. Although we have 5 mods/admins, we still had no single moderative report so far. Our server had 99.998% uptime. Smooth sailing!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Mastodon version updated to 4.1.0</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-02-22/mastodon-version-updated-to-4.1.0/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2023 21:50:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-02-22/mastodon-version-updated-to-4.1.0/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Our server &lt;a href="https://datasci.social"&gt;https://datasci.social&lt;/a&gt; just got its Mastodon version upgraded to the latest version 4.1.0 which was released two weeks ago. Most notably, you can now add alt text to images you have already posted or edit existing alt text. It has been frustrating until now to be unable to add/edit forgotten or incorrect alt text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from alt texts and many small fixes, it is now possible for admins to import server-wide domain blocks which might come in handy for server-level moderation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Growth after open registration</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-01-19/growth-after-open-registration/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2023 12:12:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-01-19/growth-after-open-registration/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Update after 1 week of open registrations at datasci.social: We had 24 new signups, growing to 64 active members.

&lt;p&gt;We now also have a new admin email address: &lt;a href="mailto:datasci.social@proton.me"&gt;datasci.social@proton.me&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a slight hiccup at datasci.social with our email provider in the last ~16 hours which has been resolved now. (Was due to #TwitterMigration) Sorry for any delays in receiving system emails, like for sign-up. #mastoadmin #serverinfo&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Custom emojis added</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2022-11-19/custom-emojis-added/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Nov 2022 22:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2022-11-19/custom-emojis-added/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;[Post copied from &lt;a href="https://datasci.social/@mszll/109372480577572934"&gt;https://datasci.social/@mszll/109372480577572934&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our first day we now have 14 active people on our &lt;a href="https://datasci.social"&gt;https://datasci.social&lt;/a&gt; server:&lt;br&gt;
6 senior / 8 junior (research-wise)&lt;br&gt;
6 female / 8 male&lt;br&gt;
3 aged 40+ / 11 below 40&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wide variation of followers (2-2580). Everything still running super smoothly. Going to continue to grow veeery carefully for now 🐌 &amp;hellip; #mastoadmin #serverinfo&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Invite only registrations</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2022-11-17/invite-only-registrations/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2022 08:18:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/blog/2022-11-17/invite-only-registrations/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;[Post copied from &lt;a href="https://datasci.social/@mszll/109365042571003803"&gt;https://datasci.social/@mszll/109365042571003803&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About our #server &lt;a href="https://datasci.social"&gt;https://datasci.social&lt;/a&gt;: We are doing invite-only sign-ups for now for technical/budget reasons, and not because of elitism. And because a slow ramp-up is more healthy for the community, #moderation etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I have run a massive online community for 20 years, 15k active users at peak, so I have some idea what I am doing. #mastoadmin #serverinfo 👍 )&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
