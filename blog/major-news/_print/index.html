In this time datasci.social has become a vibrant online community with 286 people who have joined from all over the world, from various disciplines or from industry, providing an online home for the data science community, broadly defined. Explore our awesome stream here: <a href=https://datasci.social/public/local>https://datasci.social/public/local</a></p><p><a href=https://community.datasci.social/><img alt="datasci.social is 1 year old!" src=https://datascisocial.github.io/images/social_oneyear.png title="datasci.social is 1 year old!"></a></p><p>There has been smooth, mostly constant growth over the past year, and luckily we have been facing no moderative or technical challenges. Although we have a fantasic team of <a href=https://community.datasci.social/docs/moderation/#team>6 voluntary admins/moderators</a>, they didn&rsquo;t have much to do: All that happened in a year was one week of interference from a few spam accounts spawning on other servers, which required in total 5 moderative actions. Our total downtime in this year was 488 minutes, which means an uptime of above 99.9%!</p><p>In the past months, we have also received more and more <a href=https://community.datasci.social/docs/support/#supporters>generous financial support</a> from the community (Thank you!💕), which now covers half of our running costs. This enables running our space without ads or other interferences known from for-profit platforms, and has brought us on a realistic path towards sustainable long-term operation. Also, one year ago Mastodon hosting providers were overwhelmed due to a frenzy of new servers being created, but now the dust has settled and we might look into more affordable hosting options that might have become available over time.</p><p>Our server has not reached any capacity limits yet, and also the community is doing very well, so we continue to stay open. For now we also keep registration at datasci.social to require manual approval so our server cannot get swamped with too many new, potentially malicious, registrations overnight. So far we have processed all new registration requests well within 12 hours, a time we keep striving for.</p><p>Although Mastodon is not the perfect online social network yet, it is better than other platforms we know, not least because of its extraordinary engagement and civility which makes it great for scientists. All in all, datasci.social has turned out a fantastic project and experience, <a href=https://github.com/mszell/mastoadminresources/blob/main/communityguide.md><em>much</em> smoother than anticipated</a>, which we aim to keep nurturing for many more years! 🌱</p><p><img alt="Chart showing growth of users in blue and number of posts in yellow.

For example human-centric data/network science, social data science, urban/geospatial data science, computational social science. Not welcome: bullies, harassers, big abusive/toxic egos.</p></blockquote><p>Because this server was set up with personal funding, it initially only covered up to 100 active users. Therefore it was joinable by invitation only. After a first batch of invites and snowball invites, we have grown to around 50 active members so far. However, it still feels quite empty, and after <a href=https://community.datasci.social/blog/2022-12-17/poll-on-growth/>an informal poll showed enough interest in growth</a> we now decided to expand server capacity and to open registrations temporarily to grow.</p><h3 id=philosophy-and-motivation>Philosophy, and motivation</h3><p>The server capacity has just been expanded from about 100 to 500 active members. It is still only financed from personal pockets, but we plan to soon set up a donation page where anybody can chip in if they want to help out. We have created datasci.social to counter the danger of surveillance capitalism screwing up social media and manipulating public opinion, as demonstrated recently by Twitter&rsquo;s demise. We believe we can do things better in a &ldquo;grassroots&rdquo; approach. If you agree, then datasci.social could be a fitting place for you. And if you just came to post/discuss about research - or <em>any</em> other topic you find interesting - that&rsquo;s perfect! 👍</p><h3 id=management-security-and-trust>Management, security and trust</h3><p>Growing a community needs to be done in a responsible way - as we know from <a href=https://github.com/mszell/mastoadminresources/blob/main/communityguide.md>20 years of community management experience</a>. Therefore, we made sure to adhere to the <a href=https://joinmastodon.org/covenant>Mastodon covenant</a>, which specifies that there should be at least two people with emergency server access, and that in case of a shutdown 3 months advance notice must be given to have enough time for people to download their data and emigrate. Further, we have assembled a competent and diverse admin/mod team, which currently consists of <a href=https://datasci.social/@benfmaier>Ben F. Maier</a>, <a href=https://datasci.social/@eflegara>Erika Legara</a>, <a href=https://datasci.social/@estebanmoro>Esteban Moro</a>, <a href=https://datasci.social/@mszll>Michael Szell</a>, <a href=https://datasci.social/@sdesojo>Silvia De Sojo Caso</a>. Moderation was not needed so far at all, but we are preparing to grow also this important part for the community, as needed.</p><h3 id=plans-for-2023>Plans for 2023</h3><p>For 2023 we just extended our server capacity, we ensured adherence to the <a href=https://joinmastodon.org/covenant>covenant</a>, and we have set up <a href=https://community.datasci.social>our community pages</a> to communicate updates. We have also opened registrations, and will close them once we have reached 300 members. Inspired by other science servers, registration at datasci.social requires stating a reason and your ORCID, followed by manual approval by our mod/admin team (which we aim to provide fast). This is just to make sure that we actually get researchers/professionals to sign up, and to avoid the server getting swamped overnight.</p><p>We will soon set up a donations page, monitor and adjust our server rules and community documents transparently, and grow our admin/mod team if needed. If we take any major new steps, this would be done only after some time to give the community enough time to build up and stabilize.</p><h3 id=plans-beyond-2023>Plans beyond 2023</h3><p>For the long-term we are very open to continue diluting power in the spirit of decentralization, so that datasci.social may establish a governance structure where there is never the danger that one person or a small group can screw up everything - if there is interest. Concerning growth, ideally we should not surpass some hundred active members, as more than that could become unmanageable. We are totally open to let datasci.social&rsquo;s governance develop in any conceivable stable way, from a group-led instance to a self-organized, community-governed entity like <a href=https://www.loomio.com/socialcoop>social.coop</a>. We will see what works best.</p><h3 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h3><p>If you think you fit and are interested to join <a href=https://datasci.social>datasci.social</a>, we encourage you to do so. But don&rsquo;t hesitate too long, because 300 members could be reached quite soon. In any case, have fun with Mastodon!</p><p><em>Michael & The datasci.social <a href=https://community.datasci.social/docs/moderation/#team>admin/mod team</a></em></p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-3aab844bb0e253aea353ac6a05e063e9>New team, roadmap, community pages</h1><div class=lead>We assembled a new admin/mod team, and have roadmap and community pages ready</div><div class="td-byline mb-4"><time datetime=2023-01-06 class=text-body-secondary>Friday, January 06, 2023</time></div><p>In preparation for opening datasci.social registrations next week, some news 🚨</p><ol><li><p>New mod/admin team: <a href=https://community.datasci.social/docs/moderation/>https://community.datasci.social/docs/moderation/</a> @benfmaier @eflegara @estebanmoro @sdesojo Not a single report so far, but good to be prepared.</p></li><li><p>We adhere to the Mastodon covenant: <a href=https://joinmastodon.org/covenant>https://joinmastodon.org/covenant</a></p></li><li><p>Roadmap: <a href=https://community.datasci.social/docs/roadmap/>https://community.datasci.social/docs/roadmap/</a></p></li><li><p>Community pages: <a href=https://community.datasci.social/docs>https://community.datasci.social/docs</a>, with info on management, moderation, security, server.
