Although we have a fantasic team of <a href=https://community.datasci.social/docs/moderation/#team>6 voluntary admins/moderators</a>, they didn&rsquo;t have much to do: All that happened in a year was one week of interference from a few spam accounts spawning on other servers, which required in total 5 moderative actions.

This enables running our space without ads or other interferences known from for-profit platforms, and has brought us on a realistic path towards sustainable long-term operation.

For example human-centric data/network science, social data science, urban/geospatial data science, computational social science. Not welcome: bullies, harassers, big abusive/toxic egos.</p></blockquote><p>Because this server was set up with personal funding, it initially only covered up to 100 active users. Therefore it was joinable by invitation only. After a first batch of invites and snowball invites, we have grown to around 50 active members so far. However, it still feels quite empty, and after <a href=https://community.datasci.social/blog/2022-12-17/poll-on-growth/>an informal poll showed enough interest in growth</a> we now decided to expand server capacity and to open registrations temporarily to grow.</p><h3 id=philosophy-and-motivation>Philosophy, and motivation</h3><p>The server capacity has just been expanded from about 100 to 500 active members. It is still only financed from personal pockets, but we plan to soon set up a donation page where anybody can chip in if they want to help out. We have created datasci.social to counter the danger of surveillance capitalism screwing up social media and manipulating public opinion, as demonstrated recently by Twitter&rsquo;s demise. We believe we can do things better in a &ldquo;grassroots&rdquo; approach. If you agree, then datasci.social could be a fitting place for you. And if you just came to post/discuss about research - or <em>any</em> other topic you find interesting - that&rsquo;s perfect! üëç</p><h3 id=management-security-and-trust>Management, security and trust</h3><p>Growing a community needs to be done in a responsible way - as we know from <a href=https://github.com/mszell/mastoadminresources/blob/main/communityguide.md>20 years of community management experience</a>. Therefore, we made sure to adhere to the <a href=https://joinmastodon.org/covenant>Mastodon covenant</a>, which specifies that there should be at least two people with emergency server access, and that in case of a shutdown 3 months advance notice must be given to have enough time for people to download their data and emigrate. Further, we have assembled a competent and diverse admin/mod team, which currently consists of <a href=https://datasci.social/@benfmaier>Ben F. Maier</a>, <a href=https://datasci.social/@eflegara>Erika Legara</a>, <a href=https://datasci.social/@estebanmoro>Esteban Moro</a>, <a href=https://datasci.social/@mszll>Michael Szell</a>, <a href=https://datasci.social/@sdesojo>Silvia De Sojo Caso</a>. Moderation was not needed so far at all, but we are preparing to grow also this important part for the community, as needed.</p><h3 id=plans-for-2023>Plans for 2023</h3><p>For 2023 we just extended our server capacity, we ensured adherence to the <a href=https://joinmastodon.org/covenant>covenant</a>, and we have set up <a href=https://community.datasci.social>our community pages</a> to communicate updates. We have also opened registrations, and will close them once we have reached 300 members. Inspired by other science servers, registration at datasci.social requires stating a reason and your ORCID, followed by manual approval by our mod/admin team (which we aim to provide fast). This is just to make sure that we actually get researchers/professionals to sign up, and to avoid the server getting swamped overnight.</p><p>We will soon set up a donations page, monitor and adjust our server rules and community documents transparently, and grow our admin/mod team if needed. If we take any major new steps, this would be done only after some time to give the community enough time to build up and stabilize.</p><h3 id=plans-beyond-2023>Plans beyond 2023</h3><p>For the long-term we are very open to continue diluting power in the spirit of decentralization, so that datasci.social may establish a governance structure where there is never the danger that one person or a small group can screw up everything - if there is interest. Concerning growth, ideally we should not surpass some hundred active members, as more than that could become unmanageable. We are totally open to let datasci.social&rsquo;s governance develop in any conceivable stable way, from a group-led instance to a self-organized, community-governed entity like <a href=https://www.loomio.com/socialcoop>social.coop</a>. We will see what works best.</p><h3 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h3><p>If you think you fit and are interested to join <a href=https://datasci.social>datasci.social</a>, we encourage you to do so. But don&rsquo;t hesitate too long, because 300 members could be reached quite soon. In any case, have fun with Mastodon!</p><p><em>Michael & The datasci.social <a href=https://community.datasci.social/docs/moderation/#team>admin/mod team</a></em></p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-3aab844bb0e253aea353ac6a05e063e9>New team, roadmap, community pages</h1><div class=lead>We assembled a new admin/mod team, and have roadmap and community pages ready</div><div class="td-byline mb-4"><time datetime=2023-01-06 class=text-body-secondary>Friday, January 06, 2023</time></div><p>In preparation for opening datasci.social registrations next week, some news üö®</p><ol><li><p>New mod/admin team: <a href=https://community.datasci.social/docs/moderation/>https://community.datasci.social/docs/moderation/</a> @benfmaier @eflegara @estebanmoro @sdesojo Not a single report so far, but good to be prepared.</p></li><li><p>We adhere to the Mastodon covenant: <a href=https://joinmastodon.org/covenant>https://joinmastodon.org/covenant</a></p></li><li><p>Roadmap: <a href=https://community.datasci.social/docs/roadmap/>https://community.datasci.social/docs/roadmap/</a></p></li><li><p>Community pages: <a href=https://community.datasci.social/docs>https://community.datasci.social/docs</a>, with info on management, moderation, security, server.

So far <a href=https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-12-17/our-stance-on-threads/>we have given the platform the benefit of the doubt following a vigilant &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; approach</a> - while hoping that this connection could bring about something positive. Unfortunately, with the recent change towards a <a href=https://www.wired.com/story/meta-immigration-gender-policies-change/>purposefully dehumanizing moderation policy</a>, federation with Threads has become incompatible for us. It does not help that, at the same time, <a href=https://www.404media.co/meta-is-blocking-links-to-decentralized-instagram-competitor-pixelfed/>Meta is sabotaging the open web through censorship</a>.</p><p>While Meta&rsquo;s past moderation policies were already previously <a href=https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-full-series>executed in at least a highly problematic way</a>, with this new policy Meta does not even pretend anymore to care about basic human decency. Together with all other Meta platforms like Instagram and Facebook, Threads has thus joined the ranks of platforms like X and Truth Social that expedite the spread of misinformation and hate speech contrary to a fact-based discourse based on scientific and democratic integrity.

We are closely monitoring the situation.</p></blockquote><p>Long answer: Given Meta&rsquo;s abysmal history with surveillance capitalism and human rights it is reasonable to consider Threads a bad faith actor, meaning that its activities should be assumed to underlie as exploitative as possible motives. In the context of Mastodon this could mean some kind of &ldquo;Embrace, extend, and extinguish&rdquo; strategy, indiscriminate data collection, or worse. Therefore we are empathethic with any server admin who preemptively suspends or limits the threads.net domain. From our side however, we do not follow this strategy at the moment, because:</p><ol><li>Suspending an entire instance is a huge, irreversible hammer. As per our <a href=https://community.datasci.social/docs/moderation/#server-based-moderation-blocklist>community pages</a>, &ldquo;we try to be reasonable: It can be important to block fast, but too indiscriminate blocking can also be harmful&rdquo;. Since individuals can already block a whole domain by themselves, a server-side suspension should not be implemented rashly.</li><li>It is not yet clear what potential benefits there could be from Threads federating. Although there might be little - or the cons might easily outweigh any pros - we need more information to understand this evolving situation before jumping to conclusions.</li><li>There seems to be no imminent danger yet. This gives us time to first have a considerate discussion between all admins, moderators, and other members of datasci.social. Should there be an imminent danger at any point, we would of course reevaluate quickly.</li><li>Even without any imminent danger, the reasonable point could be made that a federated Threads will undermine the Fediverse slowly or indirectly. Again, whenever there are concrete indications that this is happening or about to happen, we will act accordingly.</li><li>See more detailed arguments here: <a href=https://www.timothychambers.net/2023/06/23/project-and-the.html>https://www.timothychambers.net/2023/06/23/project-and-the.html</a></li></ol><p>We will stay vigilant and keep monitoring the situation. For now we treat threads.net just as any other instance, and we are ready to react fast if necessary. At the same time, should we ever decide that we want to limit or suspend threads.net, we will aim to give as much advance notice as possible - especially if doing so could disrupt our members.
