I have finished setting up a blog about server updates for https://datasci.social here: https://datascisocial.github.io/blog/ #serverinfo #mastoadmin  

Was a great learning experience on #githubPages, #githubActions, and #Hugo üëç  

We now also have a new admin email address: datasci.social@proton.me
This will be important for whenever we possibly have more admins in the future.
