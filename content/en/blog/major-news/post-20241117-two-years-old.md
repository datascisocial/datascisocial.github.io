[Two years ago](https://datasci.social/@mszll/109363241516092529), datasci.social was created! ü•≥2Ô∏è‚É£üéÇ  
In this time datasci.social has become a vibrant online community: We just had our 10,000th message posted. Almost 500 people have joined from all over the world so far, from various disciplines or from industry, providing an online home for the data science community, broadly defined. Explore our awesome stream here: [https://datasci.social/public/local](https://datasci.social/public/local)

The smoothly paced, mostly constant growth from the first year has continued. Since around a year, user churn has stabilized: We have on average around 3 new signups per week and 3 people becoming inactive, leading to a steady active user number somewhat above 100. With our fantastic team of [6 voluntary admins/moderators](https://community.datasci.social/docs/moderation/#team) we are thus way above most other servers in our moderator per user ratio - smooth sailing! As before, we have enough capacity to grow and are open for signups.

We had a downtime of only 10 minutes this year so far, so **our 2024 uptime is above 99.99%**. Our lifetime uptime is above 99.9%. 

Finally, [generous financial support](https://community.datasci.social/docs/support/#supporters) from the community covers most of our running costs, for which we are very grateful üíï - and sustainable! 

Although Mastodon is not the perfect online social network yet, it is better than other platforms we know, not least because of its extraordinary engagement and civility which makes it great for scientists. Mastodon is also not billionaire/VC-captured like all other major networks like Threads, X, or [Bluesky](https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/02/ulysses-pact/#tie-yourself-to-a-federated-mast). All in all, datasci.social has turned out a fantastic project and experience which we aim to keep nurturing for many more years! üå± If you like datasci.social, and if you have the means, please consider donating - every euro goes into server hosting: [https://community.datasci.social/docs/support/](https://community.datasci.social/docs/support/)
