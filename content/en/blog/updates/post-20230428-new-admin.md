One more admin joined our [team](https://community.datasci.social/docs/moderation/#team) today: Lucio La Cava ([@luciolcw](https://datasci.social/@luciolcw))
Lucio is a researcher researching the social network of Mastodon, so he has particular insights into the system.

We still had zero moderative reports on our server so far, and we have a calm pace of new sign-ups. Therefore, there is currently no necessity to extend our team, but we want to be well prepared for a possible flood of sign-ups in case other, larger online social networks collapse.

Welcome Lucio to the team, thank you for volunteering at datasci.social!
