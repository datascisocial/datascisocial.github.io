Our server https://datasci.social got its Mastodon version upgraded to the latest version 4.2.5 yesterday, immediately after a critical vulnerability became public: https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/security/advisories/GHSA-3fjr-858r-92rw. 

This long overdue update from version 4.1.9 also comes with [new features that were added in the 4.2.x line](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/09/mastodon-4.2/), for example privacy settings where you can control if you want your posts to appear in search or on the Explore page. Both are opt-in, so if you want to have this, make sure to enable them: https://datasci.social/settings/privacy
