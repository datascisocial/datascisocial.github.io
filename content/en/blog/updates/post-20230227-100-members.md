We have reached 100 members on https://datasci.social! ðŸ¥³

Since opening registrations in Jan with 50 members we have doubled in size, following a nice, steady pace of growth. We are now also posting over 100 new posts/week.

With ample capacity to grow, we encourage everyone interested in data science, network science, computational social science, and related fields to join us, or to spread the word about our place. Although we have 5 mods/admins, we still had no single moderative report so far. Our server had 99.998% uptime. Smooth sailing!

Our next step is to implement a support page for members to have the possibility to donate to the running costs of our server.

Enjoy and see you on Mastodon!
