We have more and more financial supporters that help us maintain our datasci.social Mastodon instance - A big thank you to [all our supporters](https://community.datasci.social/docs/support/#supporters)! ❤️

We are now covering around half of our running server expenses with voluntary donations, which is great news for sustaining datasci.social in the long term. Every single $ helps. There are no commercial interests behind datasci.social, just people who aim to build a good community around data science (broadly defined), therefore we will *always* be ad-free. We strive to provide the best possible service with [voluntary moderators/admins](https://community.datasci.social/docs/moderation/#team) and [as few as possible downtimes](https://community.datasci.social/docs/server/#historical-uptimes).

If you have the means, you still have 2 months left to get your name on our list of 2023 supporters who helped kickstart datasci.social: https://community.datasci.social/docs/support/

In any case, have fun on datasci.social and Mastodon!
