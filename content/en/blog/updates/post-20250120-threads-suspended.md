As [announced two weeks ago](https://datasci.social/@mszll/113798322214417466), we suspended, or "defederated from", threads.net today. So far [we have given the platform the benefit of the doubt following a vigilant "wait and see" approach](https://community.datasci.social/blog/2023-12-17/our-stance-on-threads/) - while hoping that this connection could bring about something positive. Unfortunately, with the recent change towards a [purposefully dehumanizing moderation policy](https://www.wired.com/story/meta-immigration-gender-policies-change/), federation with Threads has become incompatible for us. It does not help that, at the same time, [Meta is sabotaging the open web through censorship](https://www.404media.co/meta-is-blocking-links-to-decentralized-instagram-competitor-pixelfed/).

While Meta's past moderation policies were already previously [executed in at least a highly problematic way](https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-full-series), with this new policy Meta does not even pretend anymore to care about basic human decency. Together with all other Meta platforms like Instagram and Facebook, Threads has thus joined the ranks of platforms like X and Truth Social that expedite the spread of misinformation and hate speech contrary to a fact-based discourse based on scientific and democratic integrity. For us data scientists at datasci.social this is unacceptable - as it is for [hundreds of other mastodon servers](https://fedipact.online/) including [mstdn.social, masto.ai](https://mstdn.social/@stux/113793895110300721), or [hachyderm.io](https://community.hachyderm.io/blog/2025/01/09/defederation-from-threads/). 

[Good riddance!](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/10/how-to-delete-facebook-instagram-and-threads/)
