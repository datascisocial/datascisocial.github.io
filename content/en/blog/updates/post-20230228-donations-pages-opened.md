We opened a Patreon page to allow our members supporting our running costs financially, which is several 100$ per year: [https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=88962596](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=88962596)

We will list supporters on our support page: [https://community.datasci.social/docs/support/](https://community.datasci.social/docs/support/)

We appreciate any support - every $ counts, and all goes directly to server hosting and maintenance!
