At only 3 hours out, our server https://datasci.social just got its Mastodon version upgraded to the latest [version 4.5.3](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v4.5.3).

This long overdue update from version 4.4.1 also comes with [new features that were added in the 4.5.x line one month ago](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2025/11/mastodon-4.5/), most notably quote posts. Enjoy!
