With the possibility of the current Mastodon version to add detailed information to server rules, we added some new information to our existing rule "**No spam or commercial advertisements**". The new detailed information reads as follows:

> Accounts that make automated posts must: 1) ask for permission at signup or from the moderation team, 2) check "This is an automated account" in their profile, 3) not create more than one post per day, unless permitted by the moderation team.

This update became necessary due to a few new accounts that were created on our server in the past months that made frequent automated posts. In principle automated posts can be fine, but for our server we want these to be used sparingly to not disrupt the local organic feed too much (and to not use up unnecessary resources).

Further, we reformatted two other rules without changing them, to make them shorter and have details in the detailed information field.
