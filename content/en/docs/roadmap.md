CONDITIONAL | | Depending on need: Set up a platform for instance meta-discussions
CONDITIONAL | | Depending on interest/need: Set up a community-governance structure for community-driven decisions and financing, for example inspired by [social.coop](https://www.loomio.com/socialcoop). It could be possible to arrive at a governance structure where there is never the danger that one person or a small group can screw up everything.
