The instance was [set up on Nov 17, 2022](https://community.datasci.social/blog/2022-11-17/datasci.social-opened/), for this reason:

> The goal of this server is to create a community of nice and diverse people who are researching human-centric data science and adjacent topics. For example human-centric data/network science, social data science, urban/geospatial data science, computational social science. Not welcome: bullies, harassers, big abusive/toxic egos.

### Philosophy and motivation
The server capacity is 100 active members due to limited financing with personal funding. We are investing our personal resources to counter the danger of exploitation capitalism screwing up social media and manipulating public opinion, as demonstrated recently by Twitter's demise. We believe we can do things better in a "grassroots" approach. If you agree, then datasci.social could be the perfect place for you. And if you just came to post/discuss about research - that's perfectly fine! :)

### Registration

Registration is currently closed / invite-only [due to limited server capacity](https://community.datasci.social/blog/2022-11-17/invite-only-registrations/).
