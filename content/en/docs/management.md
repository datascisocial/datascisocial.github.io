### Raison d'√™tre
The datasci.social instance was [set up on Nov 17, 2022](/blog/2022-11-17/datasci.social-opened/), for this reason:

> The goal of this server is to create a community of nice and diverse people who are researching human-centric data science and adjacent topics. For example human-centric data/network science, social data science, urban/geospatial data science, computational social science. Not welcome: bullies, harassers, big abusive/toxic egos.

This instance aims to counter the danger of surveillance capitalism screwing up social media and manipulating public opinion, as demonstrated recently by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23551060/elon-musk-twitter-takeover-layoffs-workplace-salute-emoji">Twitter's demise</a>. We believe we can do things better in a "grassroots" approach. If you agree, then datasci.social could be a fitting place for you. And if you just came to post/discuss about research - or *any* other topic you find interesting - that's perfect! üëç See more on our [about page](/about/).
