<h1 class="text-center">Federation to the rescue</h1>
<p class="text-center">Only open-sourced, federated, decentralized social media like Mastodon can guarantee robustness to billionaire capture. Although Mastodon is not perfect, we believe it is much better than traditional social media that are controlled by hidden algorithms and practices of surveillance and exploitation capitalism.

<h1 class="text-center">Safe community for data scientists</h1>
<p class="text-center">The goal of this instance is to create a community of nice and diverse people who are researching human-centric data science and adjacent topics. For example human-centric data/network science, social data science, urban/geospatial data science, computational social science. Not welcome: bullies, harassers, big abusive/toxic egos.</p>
