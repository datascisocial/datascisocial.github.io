The goal of this server is to create a community of nice and diverse people who are researching human-centric data science and adjacent topics. For example human-centric data/network science, social data science, urban/geospatial data science, computational social science. Not welcome: bullies, harassers, big abusive/toxic egos.
This instance aims to counter the danger of surveillance capitalism screwing up social media and manipulating public opinion, as demonstrated recently by Twitter&amp;rsquo;s demise.</description></item><item><title>Moderation</title><link>https://community.datasci.social/docs/moderation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://community.datasci.social/docs/moderation/</guid><description>Team All moderation and administration is done by our volunteer admin(istrator) and mod(erator) team:
