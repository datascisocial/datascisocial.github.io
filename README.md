# datasci.social community pages
This is the content and Hugo backend to render the datasci.social community pages (including landing page and blog), at [https://datascisocial.github.io](https://datascisocial.github.io). Hugo deploys the page in the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/datascisocial/datascisocial.github.io/tree/gh-pages) via [GitHub Actions](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) using the [docsy theme](https://github.com/google/docsy). Heavily inspired by the awesome [https://community.hachyderm.io](https://community.hachyderm.io/).
